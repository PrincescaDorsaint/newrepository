#Title
Speech Recognition of Audio Files using Python
#Description
In this project I will be using speech recognition technologies to transcribe audio files to test for accurate transcription but calculating word error rates. We will be using python and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text technology to perform these tests. The script that we will be using allows us to test audio files up to a minute long. This script also allows us to add speech context and phrases for a better transcription.
